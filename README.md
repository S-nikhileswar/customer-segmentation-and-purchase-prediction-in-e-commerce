<h1>Customer Segmentation and Purchase Prediction in E-commerce</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on understanding customer behavior in e-commerce by analyzing the purchasing patterns of approximately 4,000 customers over a one-year period. The key goal is to segment customers based on their purchasing activity and predict future purchases to drive better marketing strategies and improve customer retention.</p>
<p>By applying advanced machine learning techniques, the project offers insights into customer preferences and behavior, allowing businesses to optimize their marketing efforts and boost sales.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> Group customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics using K-Means clustering.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase Prediction:</strong> Develop a model to predict future purchases from customers using machine learning algorithms.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation System:</strong> Suggest relevant products based on past purchases and customer segmentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Workflow</h2>

<h3>Data Preprocessing:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Cleaned and transformed the e-commerce dataset, handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.</li>
    <li>Engineered new features such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Customer Segmentation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Utilized K-Means Clustering to segment customers into distinct groups.</li>
    <li>Cluster analysis identified three distinct customer profiles based on their purchase patterns, spending, and behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Predictive Modeling:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Developed a machine learning model to predict future purchases based on initial purchase behavior using segmentation data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommendation System:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Implemented a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system to suggest products to customers based on their cluster's top-selling items and their own purchase history.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>RFM Model:</strong> Extracted Recency, Frequency, and Monetary features from transactional data.</li>
    <li><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> Segmented customers into clusters for targeted marketing.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase Prediction:</strong> Machine learning model to anticipate future purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>Product Recommendations:</strong> Personalized recommendations using collaborative filtering.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Explore the Results</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Customer clusters and insights.</li>
    <li>Prediction results.</li>
    <li>Product recommendations for various customer segments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Segmentation:</strong> Three main clusters of customers were identified, enabling targeted marketing strategies:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Cluster 1: High-value, frequent buyers.</li>
        <li>Cluster 2: Medium-value, occasional buyers.</li>
        <li>Cluster 3: Low-value, infrequent buyers.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Predictive Model:</strong> Accurately predicted future purchases based on initial transactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation System:</strong> Suggested relevant products to customers based on their clusterâ€™s preferences and purchase history.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Scope</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Data Integration:</strong> Extend the project to work with real-time data for dynamic customer segmentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Models:</strong> Use more sophisticated machine learning techniques (e.g., neural networks) to enhance purchase predictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalized Campaigns:</strong> Leverage insights for personalized marketing and customer retention strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-source Data Integration:</strong> Expand the system to integrate other data sources such as web activity and social media.</li>
